								<h2>Brochures on the risk of AI</h2>
								<p>I selected this piece for my showcase as it demonstrated my critical thinking and communication skills. This task allowed me to develop my
									skills as a communicator by instructing me to create 2 brochures for specific targetted audiences. This meant I had to use my communication
									accordingly to make them audience-centered by matching my tone, my vocabulary, etc. This piece pushed me out of my comfort zone as it required me to do research on a 
									topic to learn new things and to find evidence to back my points in my brochures. This task also made me learn
									how to make my work audience-centered. This piece could be improved by citing my references using proper IEEE style.

								<h2>Interview Task</h2>
								<p>I selected this piece for my showcase because it allowed me to demonstrate and develop my communication skills. For this task, I had a practice interview 
									in which I learned how to apply the 7 Cs in a formal interview. Some of the ways I demonstrated the 7 Cs were credibility, I was dressed in formal attire
									for the interview and I gave real life scenario examples for some of the points I talked about and I also showed conciseness by getting my points
									across in a short period of time while including all the important information while maintaining eye contact with the viewer. This piece pushed me out of my comfort zone as it required
									me to answer a question I was only given a short period of time to prepare for. I believe I performed this task to the best of my ability.

								<h2>Report on "Risks of AI"</h2>
								<p>I selected this piece for my showcase because it demonstrates my ability of presenting and discussing my research
									findings. Through this task, I learned how to research and find statistics to use as evidence and I learned how to cite my work properly using IEEE style.
								This piece pushed me out of my comfort zone as I had never made a report like this one before. I learned about the format of reports and which sections to add 
								in a report (letter of transmittal, contents page, executive summary, etc..) This piece is my best work as I spent a lot of time to
							to perfect it.   </p>

								<h2>Presentation on Air Pollution </h2>
								<p>I seleceted this piece for my showcase as it demonstrates my ability of working effectively in a team. This task allowed me to develop
									several communication skills such as collaboration, courtesy and completeness. By working together with a team, I created a presentation in which I spoke 
								on sub topics using clear and concise points. I made sure I kept eye contact to address the audience properly. In my presentation, I also added figures and charts 
								as evidence to back up my points.
								 This piece pushed me out of my comfort zone because
								it allowed me to collaborate and research with other people. I could improve this work by being more concise with the delivery of content.
