									My overall experience in ENG 2003 was good as I learned a lot through the activities and lectures. As a student in software engineering, I did not expect communication to be this important however, this course taught me the importance of effective communication in every engineering field. I didn’t expect to learn as much as I did from this course because I now realize that communication is one of the most important skills that every engineer must have. As engineers, communication plays an important role in different stages of our career. For example, software engineers use communication to effectively communication their skills by resumes and cover letters. Software engineers also need to communicate effectively as they will need to collaborate with other software engineers on group projects. <br> <br>

									The course content that I think was the most useful was learning about technical writing. By learning about technical writing, I learned how to write a technical. This includes the structure, the tone, how to cite my work, etc. Something new I learned through this is the IEEE style. The reason I think this was the most useful is because I also learned how to research and structure and write down my findings concisely, clear, and complete. I believe this will help me significantly in my career because it involves a lot of researching and learning. My technical report was on the topic of AI, and I feel like I learned so much about it because I learned the correct way of researching and organising my research. <br> <br>
									
									
									The topic I found the most interesting is Oral Presentations. During this topic, I learned how to prepare myself for interviews that I will need to do throughout my career. I find it interesting because I didn’t know about how big the impact of speaking comfortably during a presentation is. It makes an interview process much less stressful, and it usually has a better outcome as it results in a clear and courteous interview. I realized this when I did the practice interview assignment and spoke comfortably as if I was having a regular conversation with a person and my interview went well. <br> <br>
									
									
									Before I took ENG 2003, I didn’t implement the 7 Cs as much because I didn’t know about them. However, after the course, I feel more confident communicating as I feel like I actively try to implement the 7 Cs which improves my communication significantly. Some of the areas I feel like I have improved are writing resumes and cover letters, technical reports, and oral presentations.  <br> <br>
									
									
									The communication skill I believe I improved the most is technical writing because after learning about the 7 Cs and the axioms of communication, I learned to make my writing better grammatically and with the use of correct punctuation to ensure clarity. I learned to back my points up with concrete evidence using statistics and figures. This also ensures concreteness. I used all of this in my technical report when I gave statistics on the increase in use of AI. <br> <br>
									
									
									A communication skill I need to work on is being concise in my writing. I need to learn how to express my information with fewer words while keeping it clear and concrete.
